## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the retail data of the Kaggle Superstore dataset and
uncover insights related to product performance, regional sales trends, and customer segment profitability.

## Key Questions
***Product Performance***
1. **Profitable Products**  
   What are the 10 most profitable products?

2. **Lowest Profit or Loss of Money**  
   Which products are making the lowest profit or are losing money?

4. **High Sales and Low Profit Margins**  
   Is there a noticeable difference between high sales and low profit margins?

***Regional Analysis***
1. **Profitable Regions**  
   Which regions are the most and least profitable?

2. **Sales Volume and Profitability**  
   Does sales volume and profitability differ depending on the region?

***Customer Segmentation***
1. **Customer Segmentation Profitability**  
   How does profitability differ across customer segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)?

2. **Highest Profit Margin**  
   Which segment generates the highest profit margin on each sale?

***Time Series Analysis***
1. **Sales Over Time**  
   How do sales change over time? Are there monthly or quarterly trends?

2. **Trends**  
   Are there any patterns, such as seasonal increases or decreases in sales performance?
   
 ***Correlation & Relationships***
1. **Sales, Profit, Discount, & Quantity Correlation**  
   What is the relationship between sales, profit, discount, and quantity?

2. **Trends**  
   Do larger discounts result in better profitability, or do they have the opposite effect?

## Recommendations
After analyzing the data, the following strategies are recommended for the retail team to elevate performance:

**Focus on Profits, Not Just Sales**  
1. High sales do not necessarily mean high profits. Therefore, it is important to focus on profits, not just sales.

**Identify Costly Products**  
2. Highest total revenue. 

**City 1: Pune**  
2. Average rent per customer is very low. 

**Personalized Marketing**  
3. Marketing should be tailored toward individual customers since they are the segment that contributes to the most profits.

**Plan for Seasonal Trendsg**  
3. Seasonal trends occur each year, so planning for inventory and promotions should be made particularly for the busy Q4 period.
